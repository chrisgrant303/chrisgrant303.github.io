      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Chris Grant and I'm currently a Director of Project Management in the exhibit and tradeshow industry. I've spent the better part of 11 years in this environment and I'm excited to learn a new suite of skills that can improve the lives of my team members and clients by using data to create useful visualizations. When I'm not working, my wife and I can be found traveling as far away as possible every chance that we can afford. We have a huge passion and love for Asia.</p>

      <p>Before I began my professional endeavors nearly 10 years ago, I spent the better part of the 00's as a traveling DJ, touring most parts of Europe and the United States. I released music on several record labels and was fortunate enough to have been able to see and experience some of the greatest cities in the world under the best of circumstances. My passion for technology drove my interest in music production, and to this day, I am still found dabbling and outputting music for people to enjoy. </p>

      <p>It's my hope that with this course and these skills, I'll be able to develop a wholly new set of problem solving abilities and to be able to create whatever it is that I can dream up, both personally and professionally. </p>
