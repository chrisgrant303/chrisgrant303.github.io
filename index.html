    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>This is where I'll put in a little text, make some things <strong>strong</strong> and I'll consider maybe some other effects. For giggles, I'd like to <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" class="a">let you click this link.</a> Did you know that all links should be magenta instead?  I did that with CSS.  Cool.</p>
